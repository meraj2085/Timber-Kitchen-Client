              Difference between SQL and NoSQL

              SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational
              databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
              tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs
              that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL. The five
              critical differences between SQL vs NoSQL are: SQL databases are
              relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational. SQL databases use
              structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL
              databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. SQL
              databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are
              horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL
              databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
              SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL
              is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.{" "}

              JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
              information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
              contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
              signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
              cannot be altered after the token is issued.{" "}

              NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime
              environment that allows the javascript to be run on the
              server-side. Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the
              browser. Nodejs comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web
              development. <br />
              Javascript is a Scripting language. It is mostly abbreviated as
              JS. It can be said that Javascript is the updated version of the
              ECMA script. Javascript is a high-level programming language that
              uses the concept of Oops but it is based on prototype inheritance.

              NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
              EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
              architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite
              loop that receives requests and processes them.{" "}
